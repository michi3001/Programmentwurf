# Programmentwurf
The project is a Project made by Michael Schick at the DHBW Heidenheim. <br>
It is part of the programming module.

The result of the project is a C Code which automatically generates a picture which should look like this:
![Alt text](Vorlage.jpg?raw=true "Aufgabenbild")

If you want to adjust the number of equidistant files you have to change the constant "PARAMETER" in the constants.h file.
You find the file in the folder "headers/constants.h".
